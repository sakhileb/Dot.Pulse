 * table's column, is deliberately simple and matches the data volumes
 * this app currently runs at -- the same pragmatic choice already made
 * in App\Services\AiModerationService's synchronous, non-queued Claude
 * calls. Worth revisiting with a real query if the users table grows
 * large enough for this to matter.
